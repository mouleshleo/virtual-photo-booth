## Setting up Environment Variables

You need to configure your environment variables to handle sensitive information like your email credentials. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```bash
EMAIL=your-email@example.com
PASS=your-email-password
```

Click [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to know how to create the password for third part access to your gmail from .
After knowing about app password click [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) to set up app password (make sure you are not using student mail id and 2 step verification is enabled)
You will be prompted to enter your account password.

Other way to use this is to use a service provider like emailjs(To learn about this click [here](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) ) but this is not used here.

Make sure to replace `your-email@example.com` and `your-email-password` with your actual Gmail email and app-specific password (if using Gmail, ensure you enable less secure apps or use an app-specific password).

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to a public repository, as it contains sensitive information.
